= Adding Unsupported Repositories for Flatpak 

Flatpak applications are distributed from repositories called remotes. Red Hat provides a remote with RHEL applications. Additionally, third-party remotes are available as well.

You can add any Flatpak remote. The most popular upstream remote is Flathub.

 Note: Red Hat does not support applications from third-party remotes.

 
Instructions for adding Flathub as a remote can be found at https://flatpak.org/setup/Red%20Hat%20Enterprise%20Linux[flatpak.org^]

. Visit the link at https://flatpak.org/setup/Red%20Hat%20Enterprise%20Linux[flatpak.org^]

. Running Flatseal allows you to tweak different permissions within the Flatpak sandbox per Flatpak. The following screenshot shows changing the permissions for the Inkscape application. You can test changing the permissions on any application you installed using Flatpak.

. The Flatseal application itself has a reset button in the upper right corner. Flatpak on the command line can also reset permissions per application.
.. You can run `Flatpak permission-reset <application ID>` to do that.
