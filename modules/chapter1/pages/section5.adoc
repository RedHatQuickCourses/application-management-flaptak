= Flatpak usage

Flatpak management can be done either via the command line or the Gnome Software Center (GSC).

. To search a Flatpak application from the command line, you can run:
   
   $ flatpak search application-name

. To install a Flatpak application use the `flatpak install` command.
 
  $ flatpak install application-name

.. To install the Libreoffice application from `rhel` remote run the following command.
   
 $ flatpak search LibreOffice

 $ flatpak install rhel org.libreoffice.LibreOffice

. Gnome Software Center(GSC) also shows the rpm and Flatpak versions of packages (if available).
