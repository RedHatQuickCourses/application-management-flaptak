= Flatpak terminology

- *Flatpak*: It is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on RHEL.

- *Flatpak application*: These are the applications the user installs via the Flatpak command or via a different UI like GNOME Software.

- *Runtime*: Alternatively referred to as platforms, these are integrated platforms to provide basic utilities needed for a Flatpak application to work.

- *Flatpak bundle*: It is a specific single-file export format which contains a Flatpak app or runtime.

- *Sandboxes*: With Flatpak, each application is built and run in an isolated environment, which is called the 'sandbox'. Each sandbox contains an application and its runtime.

- *Portals*: Portals are a mechanism through which applications can interact with the host environment from within a sandbox.

- *Repositories(Remotes)*: Flatpak applications and runtimes are typically stored and published using repositories, which behave similar to Git repositories.
