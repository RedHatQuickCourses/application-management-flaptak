= Flatpak Installation

Flatpak installation and all subsequent commands work only on the graphical target or the desktop environment. If you SSH into your machine without the X11 display the installation fails.

. You install Flatpak by using the dnf install command.
 
  $ sudo dnf install flatpak

. Add the Red Hat supported Flatpak remote.
 $ sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists rhel https://flatpaks.redhat.io/rhel.flatpakrepo

. Log in to the Red Hat container catalog using your own credentials.
  
  $ podman login registry.redhat.io
    Username: your-user-name
    Password: your-password

.. If you do not have an existing credential to log in to `registry.redhat.io` then you can generate them by visiting https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/[Registry Service Accounts^] and creating a new service account.
